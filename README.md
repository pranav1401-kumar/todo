# Google Keep Lite

Google Keep Lite is a clone Application for Google Keep Note. It is used for creating notes and maintaining them using ReactJS. As it is a static application, it will majorly work with Redux to store notes, for time being will not have storage configured. It means that when we will refresh the page the data will be gone.
